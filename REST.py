#post- is most often used to create new resource .or we can say it submit the data to be processed to the server
#get-The HTTP GET method is used to **read** (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the “happy” 
(or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK).
 In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).
#put- unless you want to update/replace every resource in the entire collection.
#delete-unless you want to delete the whole collection—not often desirable
